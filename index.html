        <h3>Why we love Knockma</h3>
        <p>Knockma Forest Park offers a beautiful hillside circular walk through a woodland filled with fairy folklore
            and legend.
            A top of the summit of the hill are two Cairns believed to be the burial grounds of Queen Maeve of Connacht
            and of the
            fairy king Finvarra.

            The park features numerous benches to relax and rest throughout the walk, along with interesting flora of
            spring gentian
            and purple helleborine usually found in the famous Burren region of county Clare.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Situated 8km from Tuam and standing 167m high, Knockma offers breathtaking views of North county Galway.
            Knockma forest trail is a 4.2km trek, popular at weekends with hikers, walkers, and lovers of nature alike.
            It is a moderately challenging trail, generaly taking onea and a half hours to complete.
        </p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Knockma is covered with archaeological features that range in origins from late Mesolithic (6,000-7,000 BC)
            to early pre-Christian
            periods. Many ancient ruins remain, including cairns, underground passages and forts suggesting it was once
            a
            significant ceremonial area during the Neolithic period. There is also evidence of a major settlement that
            stretches
            back to pre-Christian times. The Kirwan family built Castle Hackett at the foot of Knockma during the 17th
            century and it's ruins remain standing to this day</p>
